So Ibn Mas'ud said: \"She gets the same dowry as other women, no less and no more, she has to observe the Iddah, and she gets inheritance.\" So Ma'qil bin Sinan Al-Ashja'I stood and said: \"The Messenger of Allah judged the same as you have judged regarding Birwa bint Washiq, a woman of ours.\" So Ibn Mas'ud was happy about that",
