Umar said to him:Messenger of Allah, give it to one who needs it more than I. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Take it; either keep it with you or give it as a charity, and whatever comes to you in the form of this type of wealth, without your being avaricious or begging for it, accept it, but in other circumstances do not let your heart hanker after it. And it was on account of this that Ibn 'Umar never begged anything from anyone, nor refused anything given to him",
