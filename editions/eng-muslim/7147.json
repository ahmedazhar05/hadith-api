It was upon this that Abu Huraira reported that Abu'l Qasim (the Holy Prophet) (ï·º) said:The (members) of the first group to get into Paradise would have their faces as bright as full moon during the night, and the next to this group would have their faces as bright as the shining stars in the sky, and every person would have two wives and the marrow of their shanks would glimmer beneath the flesh and there would be none without a wife in Paradise",
