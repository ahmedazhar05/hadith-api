So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had informed us.

The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that.
