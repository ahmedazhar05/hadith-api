Then he performed ablution and passed his (wet) hands over his Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather), stood up and prayed. He was asked about it. He replied that he had seen the Prophet (ï·º) doing the same.\" They approved of this narration as Jarir was one of those who embraced Islam very late",
