All of them can serve me, and there is no harm for any other person to do the same. `Aisha told me that she used to comb the hair of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) while she was in her menses, and he was in I`tikaf (in the mosque). He would bring his head near her in her room and she would comb his hair, while she used to be in her menses",
