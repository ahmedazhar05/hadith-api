I (Ibn Juraij, one of the narrators) said (to 'Ati'): Has this (news) reached you that Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had said:\" He (Allah's Messenger) had sent me in the latter part of the night\"? Thereupon he said: No, it was the dawn. I (again) said to him: (Did you hear) Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) having said this (too):\" We stoned al-Jamra before the dawn prayer\"? So where did he observe the dawn prayer? He said: No. But he said only so much (as described above)",
