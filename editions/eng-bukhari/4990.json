(4.95) The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Call Zaid for me and let him bring the board, the inkpot and the scapula bone (or the scapula bone and the ink pot).\"' Then he said, \"Write: 'Not equal are those Believers who sit..\", and at that time `Amr bin Um Maktum, the blind man was sitting behind the Prophet (ﷺ) . He said, \"O Allah's Apostle! What is your order For me (as regards the above Verse) as I am a blind man?\" So, instead of the above Verse, the following Verse was revealed: 'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah",
