The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked at me and left his sermon till he came to me, and he was given a chair and I thought that Its legs were made of iron. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat In it and he began to teach me what Allah had taught him. He then came (to the pulpit) for his sermon and completed it to the end",
