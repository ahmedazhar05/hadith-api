The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up there and called them, saying, \"O assembly of Jews! Surrender to Allah (embrace Islam) and you will be safe!\" They said, \"You have conveyed Allah's message, O Aba-al-Qasim\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said to them, \"That is what I want; embrace Islam and you will be safe.\" They said, \"You have conveyed the message, O Aba-al- Qasim.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said to them, \"That is what I want,\" and repeated his words for the third time and added, \"Know that the earth is for Allah and I want to exile you from this land, so whoever among you has property he should sell it, otherwise, know that the land is for Allah and His Apostle",
