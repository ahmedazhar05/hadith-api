			"text": "Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that some of the Companions of Allah's Apostle (ï·º) asked his (the Prophet's) wives about the acts that he performed in private. Someone among them (among his Companions) said:I will not marry women; someone among them said: I will not eat meat; and someone among them said: I will not lie down in bed. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah and glorified Him, and said: What has happened to these people that they say so and so, whereas I observe prayer and sleep too; I observe fast and suspend observing them; I marry women also? And he who turns away from my Sunnah, he has no relation with Me",
