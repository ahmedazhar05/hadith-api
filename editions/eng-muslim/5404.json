Umar reported:'Umar b. at-Khattab found a silk garment being sold in the market; he purchased it and brought it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, get it and adorn yourself (by wearing it) on the 'Id (days) and for the delegation. Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: That is the dress of one who has no share (in the Hereafter). 'Umar stayed there so long as Allah wished. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent him a silk cloak. 'Umar came back with that to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger. you said that it is the dress of one who has no share in the Hereafter, but then you sent it to me. Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: You sell it and meet your need (with its proceeds)",
