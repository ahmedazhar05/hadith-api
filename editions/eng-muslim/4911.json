(He said that) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered Zaid (to write the verse). He brought a shoulder-blade (of a slaughtered camel) and inscribed it (the verse) thereon. The son of Umm Maktum complained of his blindness to the Prophet (ﷺ). (At this) descended the revelation:\" Those of the believers who sit (at home) without any trouble (illness, incapacity, disability)\" (iv. 95). The tradition has been handed down through two other chains of transmitters",
