The rest of the hadith is the same, but with this addition:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was a person of gentle disposition, so when she (A'Isha) wished for a thing, he accepted it (provided it did not contravene the teachings of Islam). So he (in pursuance of her desire for a separate lhram for Umra) sent her with 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr and she put on Ihram for 'Umra at al-Tan'im. Matar and Abu Zubair (the two narrators amongst the chain of transmitters) said: Whenever 'A'isha performed Hajj she did as she had done along with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)",
