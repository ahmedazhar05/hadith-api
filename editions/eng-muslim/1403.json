It was granted permission to take two exhalations, one exhalation during the winter and the other exhalation during the summer So whatever you perceive in the form of intense cold or hurting cold is from the exhalation of Hell. And whatever you perceive in the form of extreme heat or intense beat is from the exhalation of Hell",
