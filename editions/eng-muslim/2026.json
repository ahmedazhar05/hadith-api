Abu Huraira led us in the Jumu'a prayer and recited after Surah Jumu'a in the second rak'ah:\" When the hypocrites came to thee\" (Surah 63). I then met Abu Huraira as he came back and said to him: You have recited two surahs which 'Ali b. Abu Talib used to recite in Kufah. Upon this Abu Huraira said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) reciting these two in the Friday (prayer)",
