He (Hadrat 'Umar) looked towards him (meaningfully), whereupon he (gassin) said:I used to recite (verses) when one better than you (the Holy Prophet) had been present (here). He then looked towards Abu Huraira and said to him: I adjure you by Allah (to tell) if you had not heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as saying: (Hassan), give a reply on my behalf; Allah I help him with Ruh-ul-Qudus.
