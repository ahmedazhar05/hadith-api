He said:\"Whatever a needy person takes without putting any in his pocket (and taking it away), there is no penalty on him. But whoever takes anything away, he must pay a penalty of twice its value, and be punished. Whoever steals something after it has been stored properly, and its value is equal to that of a shield, his hand must be cut off. Whoever steals something worth less than that, he must pay a penalty of twice its value and be punished",
