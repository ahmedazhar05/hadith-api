He said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has forbidden (the preparation) of Nabidh in Hantama and that is a pitcher (besmeared with pitch), in gourd and that is pumpkin, in the varnished jar, in hollow stump and in wooden vessels. This Naqir is the wood of date-palm from which the vessel is fashioned out or hollowed out, but he commanded us to prepare Nabidh in waterskins",
