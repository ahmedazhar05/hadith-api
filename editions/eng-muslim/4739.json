He came with the collection, gave it to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: This wealth is for you and this is a gift presented to me. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: Why didn't you remain in the house of your father and your mother to see whether gifts were presented to you or not. Then he stood up to deliver a sermon. Here follows the tradition like the tradition of Sufyan",
