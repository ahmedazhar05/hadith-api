He ('Adi) said: I have nothing to give you except my coat-of-mail and helmet. I will, however, write to my family to give that to you, but he did not agree to that. Thereupon 'Adi was enraged, and said: By Allah, I will not give you anything. The person (then) agreed to accept that, whereupon he said: By Allah, had I not heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying:\" He who took an oath, but then found something more pious in the sight of Allah, he should (break the oath) and do that which is more pious,\" I would not have broken the oath (and thus paid you anything)",
