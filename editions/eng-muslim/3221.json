Thabit said: Do you give religious verdict that the woman who is in menses is allowed to go without performing the last circumambulation of the House? Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said to him: Ask such and such woman of the Ansar, if you do not (believe my religious verdict) whether Allah's Messenger (ï·º) had coimmanded her this. Zaid b Thabit (went to that lady and after getting this verdict attested by her) came back to Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) smilingly and said: I did not find you but telling the truth",
