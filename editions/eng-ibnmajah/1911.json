We went to the house and sprinkled it with soft earth from the land of Batha'. Then we stuffed two pillows with (date - palm) fiber which we picked with our own hands. Then we offered dates and raisins to eat, and sweet water to drink. We went and got some wood and set it up at the side of the room, to hang the clothes and water skins on. And we never saw any wedding better than the wedding of Fatimah.”",
