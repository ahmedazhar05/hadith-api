He came and led the prayer, and after finishing it, he addressed us and said, 'All the people prayed and then slept and you had been in prayer as long as you were waiting for it.\" Al-Hasan said, \"The people are regarded as performing good deeds as long as they are waiting for doing good deeds.\" Al-Hasan's statement is a portion of Anas's [??] Hadith from the Prophet (ﷺ)",
