When those who are with the Imam have finished their one rak`a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a rak`a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two rak`at, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second rak`a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two rak`at. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not.\" Nafi` added: I do not think that `Abdullah bin `Umar narrated this except from Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (See Hadith No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly \"The Fear Prayer)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":58}}]}
