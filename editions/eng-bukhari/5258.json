Ibn `Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. `Umar then went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him to take her back and when she became clean, he could divorce her if he wanted.\" I asked (Ibn `Umar), \"Was that divorce counted as one legal divorce?\" He said, \"If one becomes helpless and foolish (will he be excused? Of course not)",
