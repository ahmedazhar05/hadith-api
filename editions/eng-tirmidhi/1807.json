So one day he sent him some food but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not eat from it. So Abu Ayyub went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'It contained garlic.' So he said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Is it unlawful?' He said: 'No, I dislike it because of its odor.'\" He said: This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
