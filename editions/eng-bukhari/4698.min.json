By Allah, it came to my mind that it must be the date palm tree.\" `Umar said, \"What prevented you from speaking\" I replied, \"I did not see you speaking, so I misliked to speak or say anything.\" `Umar then said, \"If you had said it, it would have been dearer to me than so-and-so","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":220}}]}
